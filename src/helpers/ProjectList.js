        blurb: "My Senior project as a student was to aide in overhauling the DICE website for the University of Arkansas study abroad program. The website handles complicated flows to transfer study abroad credits depending on a multitude of factors. The new site was developed in Microsoft Power Automate for a streamlined and improved user experience, with an Azure SQL database created to improve upon the SharePoint list that was used prior. Building on my prior experience, I naturally became a leader for this group by leading meetings with sponsors and taking initiative in development. Sadly, I no longer have access to the site to share."
